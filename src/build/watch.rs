//! Pure logic for `crustyimg build --watch` (SPEC-067, DEC-060).
//!
//! `--watch` re-runs the whole build whenever a source, recipe, or the manifest
//! changes, and lets the STAGE-021 cache prune the re-run to the affected outputs
//! (DEC-058) — so there is **no** change→target dependency graph here. This module
//! is the *pure, unit-tested* half of that feature: deriving what to watch, the
//! event filter that stops a build from waking itself, and the debounce that turns
//! an editor's write burst into one rebuild. The blocking `notify` wiring and the
//! rebuild loop live in `crate::cli` (`run_build_watching`); everything here is
//! deterministic and filesystem-light so it can be tested without a real watcher.
//!
//! ## The self-trigger crux (the SPEC-066 lesson, repeated)
//!
//! A watcher reports **absolute, OS-canonical** event paths; the manifest-derived
//! excluded set is **manifest-relative** (`dist/`, `.crustyimg`, the lockfile). A
//! raw string prefix check compares an absolute path against a relative one, never
//! matches, and the build's own writes to `out`/`.crustyimg` wake it again — an
//! infinite rebuild loop. [`is_excluded`] normalizes *both* sides (absolutize a
//! relative path against the CWD, then clean it lexically) and compares by path
//! **components** (so `dist` never matches `distortion`). This is the one bug that
//! must not ship, so its test is written first.
//!
//! This module is compiled **unconditionally** (it pulls in no `notify` types), so
//! its unit tests run even in the lean `--no-default-features` build.
