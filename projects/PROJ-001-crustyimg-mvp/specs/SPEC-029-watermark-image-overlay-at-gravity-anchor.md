# SPEC-029: `watermark` — image overlay at a gravity anchor

## Context

The **compositing** half of STAGE-004 and the last spec before the stage's
metadata lane is joined by its pixel-lane sibling. `watermark <inputs…> --image
LOGO` overlays a logo image onto each base at a compass **gravity** anchor, with
`--opacity`/`--scale`/`--margin`/`--tile` controls. It is a **pixel-lane
`Operation`** (DEC-002) — and the **first one that composes a second image**,
which is why it needs **DEC-031**: the overlay is loaded at the IO boundary
(`run_watermark` in `src/cli/`) and handed to the op as in-memory pixels, so
`apply()` never touches files (AGENTS.md §11 — `src/operation/**` is file-free).

A design-time probe confirmed the compositing needs **no new dependency**:
`image::imageops::overlay` (source-over alpha), alpha-scaling for `--opacity`, and
`image::imageops::resize` for `--scale` cover everything (probe results in DEC-031).

`watermark` exists today only as a clap stub (`Commands::Watermark { inputs, image,
gravity, opacity, scale, margin, tile }`) returning `CliError::NotImplemented`.

Parent: `STAGE-004-compose-and-metadata`. Governing: **DEC-002** (`Operation`
extension point), **DEC-031** (multi-image overlay boundary). Text watermark
(`ab_glyph`/`imageproc`) is a **separate** later spec.

## Goal

Wire `watermark <inputs…> --image LOGO [--gravity G] [--opacity O] [--scale S]
[--margin M] [--tile]` as a pixel-lane `Operation` that composites the overlay onto
each base at the gravity anchor, using `image::imageops` only (no new dep), through
the standard `run_pixel_op` fan-out.

## Inputs

- **Files to read:**
  - `src/operation/mod.rs` — the `Operation` trait, `OperationParams`
    (`get_str`/`get_u32`/`get_f32`), the `Resize` op (model for a parameterized op +
    `apply` using `image::imageops`), `OperationError::Apply`. ADD `Gravity` +
    `Watermark` here.
  - `src/cli/mod.rs` — `Commands::Watermark` (declared), its `NotImplemented` arm,
    `run_thumbnail`/`run_pixel_op` (build a `Pipeline`, run the fan-out), `GlobalArgs`,
    `CliError::Usage`.
  - `src/image/mod.rs` — `Image::{load, width, height, pixels, with_pixels}`.
  - `decisions/DEC-031-*.md` (the probe + the overlay-loading boundary).
- **External crate (already a dep):** `image` 0.25 — `imageops::{overlay, resize}`,
  `RgbaImage`, `DynamicImage`, `FilterType`. No new dependency (DEC-031).
- **Related code paths:** `src/operation/mod.rs`, `src/cli/mod.rs`, `tests/`.

## Outputs

- **Files modified:**
  - `src/operation/mod.rs` — add:
    - `pub enum Gravity { Center, North, South, East, West, NorthEast, NorthWest, SouthEast, SouthWest }`
      with `FromStr`/parse + `Display` (string round-trip for params).
    - `pub struct Watermark { overlay: DynamicImage, overlay_path: String, gravity: Gravity, opacity: f32, scale: Option<f32>, margin: u32, tile: bool }`
      + `impl Operation` (`name`="watermark"; `params()` serializes path+placement;
      `apply()` composites).
    - A `pub fn` constructor (e.g. `Watermark::new(...)`) so the CLI builds it.
  - `src/cli/mod.rs` — `run_watermark(inputs, image, gravity, opacity, scale, margin,
    tile, global)`; wire the `Commands::Watermark` dispatch arm.
  - `docs/api-contract.md` — flesh out the `watermark` entry (done at design).
- **New exports:** `crate::operation::{Gravity, Watermark}`.
- **Database changes:** none.

## Command surface (PINNED)

```
crustyimg watermark <INPUTS...> --image LOGO [--gravity G] [--opacity O]
                                [--scale S] [--margin M] [--tile]
```

- **`--image LOGO`** (required) — the overlay file. Loaded once by `run_watermark`
  via `Image::load`; a missing/unreadable/undecodable logo → exit **3** (load error).
- **`--gravity G`** (default **`southeast`**) — compass anchor; one of
  `center north south east west northeast northwest southeast southwest`. Unknown →
  `CliError::Usage` (exit **2**).
- **`--opacity O`** (default **1.0**) — overlay alpha multiplier in **[0.0, 1.0]**;
  outside → exit **2**. Implemented by multiplying the overlay's alpha channel by O.
- **`--scale S`** (optional; default = overlay native size) — resize the overlay so
  its **width = S × base width** (aspect preserved). `S ≤ 0` → exit **2**.
- **`--margin M`** (u32, default **0**) — inset in pixels from the anchored edges
  (ignored for `center` and when `--tile`).
- **`--tile`** — repeat the (scaled, opacity-adjusted) overlay to cover the whole
  base; **ignores `--gravity` and `--margin`**.
- **Compositing:** convert base to RGBA, alpha-composite the overlay with
  `image::imageops::overlay` (source-over); out-of-bounds placement clips cleanly
  (probe-verified, no panic). It is a normal pixel-lane op — output format/quality and
  the fan-out are handled by `run_pixel_op` (DEC-015): single → stdout/`-o`/`--out-dir`,
  multi → `--out-dir`, per-input failure → exit 6.

## Operation mechanics (PINNED — probe-verified)

`Watermark::apply(base)`:
1. `let mut canvas = base.pixels().to_rgba8();` (work in RGBA8).
2. Prepare the overlay RGBA: `let mut ov = self.overlay.to_rgba8();`
   - if `Some(s) = self.scale`: target width `w = (canvas.width() as f32 * s).round()`,
     height scaled to preserve the overlay aspect; `ov = imageops::resize(&ov, w, h,
     FilterType::Lanczos3)` (`w`/`h` ≥ 1).
   - if `self.opacity < 1.0`: for each pixel `p.0[3] = (p.0[3] as f32 *
     self.opacity).round() as u8`.
3. Placement:
   - `tile`: for `y in (0..canvas.height()).step_by(ov.height())` and `x` similarly,
     `imageops::overlay(&mut canvas, &ov, x as i64, y as i64)` (edge tiles clip).
   - else: compute `(x, y)` from `gravity` over `(canvas.w/h, ov.w/h, margin)` — e.g.
     SE = `(W-ow-m, H-oh-m)`, center = `((W-ow)/2, (H-oh)/2)`, N = `((W-ow)/2, m)`,
     etc. (saturating so anchors stay ≥ 0); `imageops::overlay(&mut canvas, &ov, x, y)`.
4. `Ok(base.with_pixels(DynamicImage::ImageRgba8(canvas)))`. Validation failures (bad
   opacity/scale) are caught in the CLI before constructing the op, so `apply` only
   returns `OperationError::Apply` on genuinely unexpected failures.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `watermark base --image logo --gravity southeast` places the overlay in the
  bottom-right; far corner pixels match the overlay, opposite corner unchanged.
- [ ] `--opacity 0.5` blends (the overlaid region is a base/overlay mix, not the pure
  overlay color).
- [ ] `--scale 0.5` resizes the overlay to ~half the base width before compositing.
- [ ] `--margin M` offsets the anchor inward by M px.
- [ ] `--tile` repeats the overlay across the whole base (overlay color appears in
  multiple, far-apart regions); `--gravity`/`--margin` ignored.
- [ ] `--gravity center` centers the overlay.
- [ ] Missing/unreadable `--image` → exit **3**; bad `--opacity` (e.g. 2.0) or
  `--scale 0` or unknown `--gravity` → exit **2**.
- [ ] Multi-input fan-out: two bases + `--out-dir` → two composited outputs; overlay
  loaded once.
- [ ] No new dependency (`cargo deny` green); op lives in `src/operation/`, the file
  load only in `src/cli/` (DEC-031).

## Failing Tests

Written during **design**, BEFORE build. Native fixtures (solid-color `RgbaImage`s
via the `image` crate); no ImageMagick. Unit tests construct `Watermark` directly with
an in-memory overlay `DynamicImage`.

- **`src/operation/mod.rs` (unit, `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`)**
  - `"gravity_parse_round_trips"` — `Gravity::from_str` accepts the 9 names (+ rejects
    junk → error); `to_string` round-trips.
  - `"watermark_southeast_places_overlay"` — base 20×20 red, overlay 4×4 blue, SE,
    margin 0 → pixel (18,18) is blue, (0,0) is red.
  - `"watermark_center_places_overlay"` — overlay centered; middle pixel is overlay,
    corners are base.
  - `"watermark_opacity_blends"` — opacity 0.5 → overlaid pixel is a red/blue blend
    (neither pure base nor pure overlay).
  - `"watermark_scale_resizes_overlay"` — scale 0.5 on a 20-wide base → the overlaid
    region spans ~10 px wide (overlay color present across ~half-width, not 4 px).
  - `"watermark_margin_offsets_anchor"` — SE margin 2 → overlay shifted 2 px inward
    (corner pixel reverts to base; the inset block is overlay).
  - `"watermark_tile_covers_base"` — tile → overlay color appears in both the
    top-left and bottom-right regions.
  - `"watermark_params_includes_path_and_placement"` — `params()` emits `image`
    (path), `gravity`, `opacity`, `scale`, `margin`, `tile`.
- **`tests/watermark.rs` (integration, drives the binary)**
  - `"watermark_writes_composited_output"` — `watermark base.png --image logo.png -o
    out.png` → exit 0; out decodes and differs from base.
  - `"watermark_missing_image_exits_3"` — `--image nonexistent.png` → exit 3.
  - `"watermark_bad_opacity_exits_2"` — `--opacity 2.0` → exit 2.
  - `"watermark_unknown_gravity_exits_2"` — `--gravity sideways` → exit 2.
  - `"watermark_multi_input_fanout"` — two bases + `--out-dir` → two outputs; exit 0.
- **`tests/cli.rs`** — `"watermark"` is already in the subcommand-list tests
  (SPEC-007); confirm, add only if missing.

## Implementation Context

*Read this section (and the files it points to) before starting the build cycle.*

### Decisions that apply

- `DEC-031` — **the key one.** Overlay loaded at the IO boundary (`run_watermark`),
  op holds in-memory pixels, `apply()` is file-free, watermark NOT in
  `with_builtins()` (recipe round-trip is STAGE-005). Mirror its probe.
- `DEC-002` — `watermark` is a new `Operation` impl (the pixel extension point); do
  not route it through the metadata lane.
- `DEC-008` — the SIMD resize backend; `--scale` may reuse it or `image::imageops::
  resize` (Lanczos3) — overlay scaling is not perf-critical, either is fine.
- `DEC-015` — fan-out/exit semantics come free from `run_pixel_op`.
- `DEC-007` — typed errors; CLI validates opacity/scale/gravity (→ `Usage`, exit 2);
  no `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic!` off test paths.

### Constraints that apply

- `src/operation/**` must not depend on files/clap/terminals (AGENTS.md §11) —
  enforced by DEC-031 (load in CLI, not in the op).
- `no-new-top-level-deps-without-decision` — none added (compositing via `image`).
- `clippy-fmt-clean`, `every-public-fn-tested`, `no-unwrap-on-recoverable-paths`.

### Prior related work

- `SPEC-010` (resize) — the closest model: a parameterized `Operation` whose `apply`
  uses `image::imageops`; `run_thumbnail` builds a `Pipeline` + calls `run_pixel_op`.
- `SPEC-013` (auto-orient) — another op + its CLI handler.

### Out of scope (for this spec specifically)

- **Text watermark** (`ab_glyph` + `imageproc::drawing`) — a separate STAGE-004 spec
  with its own font-dependency DEC.
- **Recipe round-trip** of `watermark` (registering it in `with_builtins`, resolving
  the overlay path in the recipe loader) — STAGE-005 (DEC-031 defers this).
- Blend modes beyond source-over, rotation of the overlay, caption/shapes/borders,
  montage/append — post-MVP (docs/backlog.md).

## Notes for the Implementer

- **Mirror DEC-031's probe** — `imageops::overlay(&mut base_rgba, &overlay_rgba, x:
  i64, y: i64)` is source-over alpha; out-of-bounds clips (no panic). Opacity =
  multiply overlay alpha; scale = `imageops::resize`.
- **`run_watermark` is the IO boundary** — `Image::load(image)` (→ exit 3 on
  failure), validate `opacity ∈ [0,1]` / `scale > 0` / gravity parse (→ `Usage`, exit
  2) BEFORE constructing the op, then `Watermark::new(overlay_dynimg, path, gravity,
  opacity, scale, margin, tile)`, `Pipeline::new().push(op)`,
  `run_pixel_op(pipeline, inputs, global, global.quality, None, None)`.
- Reuse the **global** `--out-dir`/`-q`/`-y`/`-o` flags — do NOT declare locals (the
  SPEC-024 collision lesson).
- Put `watermark` integration tests in a new `tests/watermark.rs`; keep diagnostics on
  stderr.
- `Gravity` belongs in `src/operation/` (placement math + future `crop` reuse, AGENTS.md
  §14); give it `FromStr` (parse errors map to `CliError::Usage` at the CLI).
