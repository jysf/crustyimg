    Turn crustyimg from a tool that RUNS image transforms into one that BUILDS an
    asset tree incrementally and verifiably — "a Makefile for images." Today `apply
    --recipe` re-does all the work on every run and offers no reproducibility
    guarantee; this wave adds a declared `build` (sources × recipes → outputs), a
    content-addressed cache so a re-run does only the work that changed, and a
    committed lockfile that pins the build so CI can assert outputs are reproducible
    — plus `--watch` for the dev inner loop. This is the roadmap's Wave 2 and the
    "build-native & verifiable, no service, no CDN" half of the territory thesis:
    deterministic, reviewable, local. It is also near-ideal agent/automation work —
    turborepo/Bazel-shaped, clear pass/fail.
  beneficiaries:
    - "Frontend/content devs with an asset tree (many images × recipes) who want fast incremental rebuilds"
    - "Build-step / Makefile / GitHub-Actions shops that want image outputs reviewed + verified like code"
    - "CI (a committed lockfile → 'outputs match' gate; cache hits → fast pipelines)"
    - "The maintainer/agents (a deterministic, well-specified, clear-pass/fail surface)"
  success_signals:
    - "`crustyimg build` runs a declared build; a second run with no changes does ZERO work (full cache hit) and says so"
    - "Changing one source (or one recipe param, or the crustyimg version) rebuilds ONLY the affected outputs"
    - "A committed lockfile pins the build; `build --check`/`--frozen` fails in CI when outputs would drift"
    - "`build --watch` re-runs only affected targets on file changes"
    - "Same inputs + recipes + crustyimg version → stable, reproducible outputs (the lockfile is meaningful)"
  risks_to_thesis:
    - "Encoder byte-reproducibility across platforms/versions is UNVERIFIED — it decides whether the lockfile can pin OUTPUT hashes or only cache keys (the load-bearing probe)"
    - "Cache-key correctness is the classic hard problem: miss one output-affecting input (a param, quality, the version) → stale outputs shipped silently"
    - "Scope creep into a general build system — this must stay 'a Makefile for images', not Bazel"
    - "`--watch` reliability (debounce, rename/atomic-write editors, large trees) is fiddly cross-platform"

# PROJ-007: Reproducible build (build + cache + lockfile + `--watch`)

## What This Project Is

The **reproducible-build wave** — roadmap Wave 2. crustyimg already runs an ordered
TOML recipe over one image or a batch (`apply --recipe`, decode-once pipeline, rayon
batch). This wave wraps that in a declared, cached, verifiable **build**: you declare
targets (source globs × a recipe → an output directory + name template), and
`crustyimg build` resolves them, runs them through the existing pipeline, and — via a
**content-addressed cache** — does only the work that actually changed. A committed
**lockfile** pins the resolved build so a re-run (or CI, or a teammate) is
**reproducible and checkable**, and `--watch` gives the fast dev inner loop. The
pitch is "a Makefile for images, verifiable" — the local, deterministic, no-service
counterpart to a delivery CDN's per-request `f_auto` (`docs/territory.md`).

## Why Now

- **It's the best daily-driver feature and the cleanest agent work left before 1.0.**
  The input-reach wave (PROJ-009) broadened *what* crustyimg reads; this wave makes
  *running it over a real asset tree* fast and trustworthy. It is turborepo/Bazel-shaped
  — deterministic, well-specified, clear pass/fail — so it is exactly the kind of work
  that goes fast and reviews cleanly (roadmap sequencing rationale, 2026-07-07).
- **It completes the "build-native & verifiable" leg of the identity.** `docs/territory.md`
  stakes the claim on *deterministic, reproducible recipes reviewed like code* for the
  build/CI/pre-deploy layer. Without incremental + lockfile, "reviewed like code" is
  aspirational; this wave makes it real.
- **The load-bearing unknown is small and probeable now.** Whether our encoders are
  byte-reproducible (across a re-run, and across platforms) decides the lockfile design —
  a design-time probe (encode the same input twice; diff bytes) resolves it before we
  commit to hashing outputs vs. only cache keys.

## Success Criteria

- `crustyimg build` runs a declared build end to end; a no-change re-run is a **full
  cache hit** (near-zero work) and reports hits/misses/rebuilt.
- A change to a single source, recipe param, or the crustyimg version **rebuilds only
  the affected outputs** (correct, minimal invalidation).
- A committed **lockfile** makes the build reproducible; a `--check`/`--frozen` mode is
  a CI gate that fails on drift, with a clear diff.
- `build --watch` re-runs only affected targets on file changes (debounced, robust to
  editor atomic-writes).
- Everything stays **local + deterministic + no service** (no CDN, no network cache) and
  pure-Rust-default; `just deny` green; the lean build unaffected.

## Scope

### In scope
- A **`build` command** driven by a declared build (targets: source globs × a recipe →
  output dir + name template), over the existing pipeline/batch. **(STAGE-020)**
- A **content-addressed cache** — a local store keyed by a hash of (input bytes +
  resolved recipe/params + crustyimg version + output config); skip-unchanged;
  hit/miss/rebuilt reporting. **(STAGE-021)**
- A **reproducibility lockfile** (source→output content hashes + resolved config) +
  `build --check`/`--frozen` for CI. **(STAGE-022)**
- **`--watch`** — a file-watching inner loop that rebuilds only affected targets. **(STAGE-023)**
- The **determinism decisions** these require (what is in the cache key; whether the
  lockfile pins output hashes or only cache keys; encoder-reproducibility policy).

### Explicitly out of scope
- The **web-asset manifest / placeholders / favicon** (Wave 4 / PROJ-005) — a build could
  later *emit* a manifest as one output type, but the manifest artifact + SSG integration
  are a separate wave.
- **Remote / distributed / networked cache** — local only (the no-service, no-CDN guardrail,
  `docs/territory.md`). No cache server, no cloud.
- **WASM / demo page** (Wave 3), **geometry** (Wave 5), **smart-crop/auto-color** (post-1.0 beta).
- A general-purpose build system / arbitrary task graph — this is "a Makefile for images",
  scoped to image targets over recipes, not shelling out to arbitrary commands.
- New **input or output formats** (PROJ-009 covered inputs; encoders are as shipped).

## Stage Plan

Format: `- [status] STAGE-ID — one-line summary`

- [~] STAGE-020 (active — framed 2026-07-08) — the `build` command + `crustyimg.build.toml` manifest
  (targets = source × recipe → out/name) + executor that loops the shipped `apply_one` over targets. The
  skeleton: "declare my asset build and run it." **No new dep** (SPEC-063, DEC-057). **← active**
- [ ] (not yet framed) STAGE-021 — content-addressed cache (incremental rebuild): the cache key +
  local store + skip-unchanged + hit/miss reporting. The headline; includes the encoder-determinism probe.
- [ ] (not yet framed) STAGE-022 — reproducibility lockfile + `build --check`/`--frozen` (the CI drift gate). The "verifiable."
- [ ] (not yet framed) STAGE-023 — `--watch`: debounced file-watching inner loop that rebuilds only affected targets.

**Count:** 0 shipped / 1 active / 3 pending (STAGE-020 active/framed; then 021 cache, 022 lockfile, 023 watch)

## Dependencies

### Depends on
- Shipped recipe/apply/pipeline surface: `src/recipe/` (Recipe TOML + `build_pipeline` + registry, DEC-005),
  `src/pipeline/` (decode-once executor), the `apply --recipe` batch path (SPEC-031, rayon, DEC-006),
  `src/source/` (glob/dir resolution), `src/sink/` (file/dir + name templates).
- PROJ-009 (input reach) — `build` ingests AVIF/SVG/RAW inputs like any other now.
- DEC-004 (pure-Rust default), DEC-034 (decode caps), the `untrusted-input-hardening` posture.
- A new hashing dep (e.g. `blake3`, permissive) + a file-watch dep (e.g. `notify`, permissive) — each
  gated behind a `DEC-*` at the stage that needs it (probe licenses + determinism first).

### Enables
- The SSG web-asset **manifest** (Wave 4) — it describes the outputs this build produces.
- **Reproducible releases / CI** for anyone using crustyimg in a build step; the "reviewed like code" story.
- Faster large-tree runs generally (the cache benefits `apply`/batch too).

## Project-Level Reflection

*Filled in when status moves to shipped.*

- **Did we deliver the outcome in "What This Project Is"?** <yes/no + notes>
- **How many stages did it actually take?** <number, compare to plan>
- **What changed between starting and shipping?** <one or two sentences>

  - <one-line updates>
- **What did we defer to the next project?**
  - <one-line items>

*Lineage: this instantiates the roadmap's provisional "PROJ-007 (determinism)" as the concrete
build/cache/lockfile/`--watch` wave (Wave 2). Other things the drafts once parked under PROJ-007 — a
permissive quantizer (indexed-PNG), SVG favicons — are NOT part of this project: the quantizer lives in
`guidance/license-watchlist.yaml`, SVG shipped in PROJ-009, and favicons are Wave 4.*
