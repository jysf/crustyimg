    The payoff of the WASM wave: a zero-install, shareable "watch it just work" demo — drop an

    - "A static, client-side single-page demo: drop/paste an image → declare an intent → see the optimized modern-format result + format chosen + bytes saved + an explain readout → download — 100% in-browser, no backend"
    - "In-browser conversion over the proven WASM core (SVG + PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP decode; AVIF/WebP/PNG encode), consuming crustyimg-wasm"
    - "AVIF encode off the main thread (Web Worker + visible progress — rav1e runs serial on wasm), and .avif INPUTS decoded page-side via createImageBitmap (the wasm build can't decode AVIF)"

    - "Become a web app or absorb the maintainer's separate site-builder/content tool (the manifest is the seam; NO HTML-generation product here)"
    - "Publish to npm (SPEC-076) or change the engine/WASM surface (STAGE-025/026 shipped those)"
    - "Require threads/SharedArrayBuffer — stay single-threaded so a plain static host works"

# STAGE-027: demo page

## What This Stage Is

The **"watch it just work" artifact.** A static, client-side single-page demo where you drop an
image, declare an intent (a quality target / byte budget / output format), and watch crustyimg —
running entirely in your browser over the shipped WASM core — turn it into the smallest
modern-format artifact, showing the **format it chose, the bytes it saved, and why** (the
`explain`/`info` readout), with a download. No upload, no backend, no install. It consumes
`crustyimg-wasm` (STAGE-026) and is the flagship the Track-B funnel finally points at — the Show HN
moment. When it ships, PROJ-008's public face is done.

## Why Now

- **STAGE-025 + STAGE-026 delivered the substance** — the engine is proven, sized (1.33 MB brotli),
  and packaged. This stage is the payoff: making it *visible and shareable*.
- **The roadmap names the demo the highest-ROI marketing artifact** ("zero-install try it,
  inherently shareable; time the Show HN here"). Adoption is the binding constraint; this is the
  artifact that converts interest.
- **It pairs with the launch** — `npm publish` (SPEC-076) is deliberately held to go out *with* the
  demo (demo live + package published + Show HN), not before it.

## Success Criteria

- A **static, client-side** page (no backend, no network calls for the conversion): drop/paste an
  image → pick an intent → get an optimized modern-format result + **format chosen + bytes saved +
  an explain/info readout** → **download** it. Works offline once loaded.
- **In-browser conversion** over the WASM core: decode SVG + PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP; encode to WebP/PNG
  and **AVIF** (the "drop a PNG, get a tiny AVIF" headline). AVIF encode runs **in a Web Worker with
  visible progress** (rav1e is serial on wasm — must not freeze the page). `.avif` **inputs** are
  decoded page-side via **`createImageBitmap`** (the wasm build encodes but can't decode AVIF).
- **Honest capability surface** — WebP output is currently *lossless* on wasm (no lossy-WebP
  encoder in the wasm feature set); the demo must not offer a "lossy WebP" it can't produce, or must
  label it honestly. No faked results.
- **Static-hostable** (GitHub Pages or equivalent), **single-threaded** — no SharedArrayBuffer, so
  no COOP/COEP headers the host can't set. First load is reasonable given the 1.33 MB brotli core.
- Honors the guardrails: no service/CDN; no HTML-generation product; the demo is crustyimg's own
  thin marketing page, distinct from the maintainer's separate site/content tool.

## Scope

### In scope
- The demo page (HTML/CSS/JS, or a deliberately light framework) consuming `crustyimg-wasm`; drag-drop
  + intent controls (format / quality-or-budget) + result preview + format/bytes/explain readout +
  download; a Web Worker wrapping AVIF encode with progress; `createImageBitmap` for `.avif` inputs;
  a static build + hosting setup (GitHub Pages workflow); a size/first-load sanity pass.

### Explicitly out of scope
- A backend/service; a general web app; the site-builder/content tool; `npm publish` (SPEC-076);
  engine/WASM-surface changes; threads/SharedArrayBuffer; lossy-WebP encode on wasm (a separate
  future codec question).

## Spec Backlog

Format: `- [status] SPEC-ID (cycle) — one-line summary`

- [x] SPEC-077 (shipped 2026-07-13, PR #85 `9a61787`) — **demo skeleton, single-threaded.** A static,
  no-bundler page that loads `crustyimg-wasm` (`import init … from crustyimg.js; await init()` —
  served over HTTP, NOT `file://`, per the wasm MIME/streaming grounding), drop-an-image →
  `optimize`/`transform` → result + `info` + bytes → download; SVG + PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP in, **WebP/PNG
  out** (AVIF deferred to 078 — needs the worker); GitHub Pages deploy through `just wasm-build`
  (size-profiled `.wasm`); browser-driven smoke. The end-to-end "it works in a browser" proof.
- [ ] SPEC-078 (not yet framed) — **make it not-freeze + honest + polished.** AVIF encode in a Web
  Worker with progress (rav1e serial); `.avif` inputs via `createImageBitmap`; the explain/bytes-saved
  readout; the honest WebP-lossless labeling; intent controls (quality/budget/format). May split.

**Count:** 1 shipped / 0 active / 1 pending (SPEC-077 SHIPPED 2026-07-13 — the demo runs in a real browser, drop→convert→download, deploy gated on a headless-Chrome smoke; only SPEC-078 (Web Worker for ALL conversions + AVIF + `.avif`-input via createImageBitmap + explain + intent controls) left, then STAGE-027 completes). **⚠ Carry: GitHub Pages is NOT enabled on the repo — the deploy workflow is correct but has never published (maintainer: Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions).**

## Design Notes

- **Consume the package, but dev against local `pkg/`.** The demo imports `crustyimg-wasm`; during
  dev that's the local `just wasm-build` `pkg/` (or `npm link`), so the demo doesn't block on
  SPEC-076's publish. At launch, repoint to the published package.
- **The carries from STAGE-025/026 are load-bearing here** (all recorded): rav1e runs *serial* on
  wasm → AVIF encode MUST be a Web Worker with progress or the page hangs; the wasm build can't
  decode AVIF → `.avif` inputs use `createImageBitmap`; `optimize(_, "webp")` returns *lossless* WebP
  → don't offer a lossy-WebP the engine can't make; the `--target web` package needs `await init()`.
- **Single-threaded on purpose** — SharedArrayBuffer/threads need COOP/COEP headers GitHub Pages
  can't set, so stay single-threaded (rav1e already runs serial). Don't reach for wasm threads.
- **Guardrail:** this is a thin marketing/demo page, not a product or the maintainer's site-builder.
  No routing/templating/CMS. If it grows those, it's out of scope.

## Dependencies

### Depends on
- STAGE-025 (WASM core) + STAGE-026/SPEC-075 (`crustyimg-wasm`, `just wasm-build`/`pkg/`).
- External: a static host (GitHub Pages); the browser `createImageBitmap` + Web Worker APIs.

### Enables
- The Show HN / adoption moment (Track B); pairs with SPEC-076's publish at launch.
- Cutting toward 1.0 (the demo + library are the last WASM-wave deliverables).
