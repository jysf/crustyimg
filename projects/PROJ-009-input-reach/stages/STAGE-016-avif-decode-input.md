    Delivers the project's headline — reading AVIF from the default, pure-Rust,
    zero-system-dep binary — which immediately extends every shipped command to
    AVIF inputs and gives the optimize/format-decision engine a new candidate.
  delivers:
    - "`.avif` decodes to the canonical `Image` in the DEFAULT build (no dav1d/C, no system libs)"
    - "`.avif` is discovered by directory/glob sources and flows through optimize/convert/info"
    - "A recorded decoder-dependency decision (DEC-053) proving the pure-Rust, permissive, patent-clean path"
  explicitly_does_not:
    - "Add AVIF animation or grid/tiled multi-image decode (single primary image only)"
    - "Change AVIF OUTPUT (still the off-by-default `avif`/ravif encode feature, DEC-020)"
    - "Add format-preservation bias to the decide engine (possible follow-up, not here)"
    - "Pull dav1d or any C/system dependency onto the default path"

# STAGE-016: AVIF decode as a default, pure-Rust input

## What This Stage Is

The stage that lets the default crustyimg binary **read AVIF**. Today AVIF is output-only
and off-by-default, because `image` 0.25's AVIF *decode* path pulls **dav1d (a C system
dep)** — unacceptable for the pure-Rust default (DEC-004). This stage adds a **permissive,
pure-Rust AVIF decoder** so `crustyimg optimize photo.avif -o out.webp` (and `convert`,
`info`, batch) just work in the default build with no system libraries. AVIF/AV1 is
**patent royalty-free** (AOMedia grant), so — unlike HEIC (DEC-052) — it belongs on the
default path, not behind a feature. The format-detection seam already dispatches by magic
bytes; the work is choosing + wiring the decoder and admitting `.avif` to the source
allow-list.

## Why Now

- **Highest-leverage, patent-clean input.** AVIF is the most-requested modern format and the
  one we can ship by default without a patent asterisk. It makes every shipped command more
  useful overnight and feeds the optimize engine a new candidate.
- **Foundational.** The ISOBMFF/container handling here (if the chosen decoder needs box
  parsing) is reusable for RAW-CR3 preview (STAGE-018) and a future permissive HEIC path.

## Success Criteria

- `Image::load("x.avif")` / `Image::from_bytes(..)` decode a real AVIF to pixels in the
  **default** build (no `avif`/dav1d/system-lib features), honoring the DEC-034 decode caps.
- `optimize`/`convert`/`info` operate on `.avif` inputs end to end; directory/glob sources
  discover `.avif`; a corrupt/oversize AVIF surfaces a typed `ImageError` (not a panic).
- **No C/system dependency on the default path**; `just deny` green (permissive license, no
  new copyleft/exception); the lean `--no-default-features` build still succeeds.
- A **DEC-053** records the decoder-dependency choice from a design-time probe (candidates,
  license, pure-Rust/patent verification, and why it beats the dav1d path).

## Scope

### In scope
- Pick + wire a permissive pure-Rust AVIF decoder; admit `.avif` to `IMAGE_EXTENSIONS`;
  decode-cap + typed-error coverage. **(SPEC-058)**

### Explicitly out of scope
- AVIF animation / grid-tiled multi-image; AVIF output changes; decide-engine format
  preservation; SVG/RAW/HEIC (later stages).

## Spec Backlog

Format: `- [status] SPEC-ID (cycle) — one-line summary`

- [x] SPEC-058 (shipped on 2026-07-07) — AVIF **decode + color/alpha + container**: `re_rav1d`
  (no-asm) + `avif-parse` (MPL-2.0) → YUV→RGB(A) honoring bit depth / chroma / nclx-CICP /
  premultiplied alpha; wired into `decode_with_limits` (ftyp-brand dispatch) + `IMAGE_EXTENSIONS`;
  DEC-034 caps, typed errors, grid reject-cleanly, cargo-fuzz target; DEC-053; deny.toml MPL/CC0
  exceptions. PR #65 (c0bc928), 20/20 CI green incl. clean Windows (no nasm).
- [x] SPEC-059 — **NOT NEEDED / dropped** (build decision 2026-07-07): `avif-parse` covered the
  container cleanly *within* SPEC-058, so no separate container spec was written.

**Count:** 1 shipped / 0 active / 0 pending — single-spec stage complete (SPEC-059 folded into 058)

## Design Notes

- **DEEP-DIVE RESULT (2026-07-07) — a viable permissive pure-Rust path IS confirmed; AVIF keeps the
  Wave-1 headline.** No clean drop-in exists (mature drop-ins are C-backed or AGPL), BUT the
  **`re_rav1d` (BSD-2) + `avif-parse` (MPL-2.0) + glue** path works, ~1–1.5 person-weeks. Crucially,
  `re_rav1d` re-exports the **safe `dav1d-rs` Rust API** (not just a C ABI — the first quick probe
  was wrong), and its **no-asm build has zero build-tool deps** (no nasm). Same decoder serves the
  Wave-3 WASM demo. See `guidance/license-watchlist.yaml` → `avif-decode` + SPEC-058's probe section.
- **DEC-053 (at build):** adopt `re_rav1d` (no-asm) + `avif-parse`. Split into a container spec
  (SPEC-059, wrap/verify `avif-parse`) + the decode+color spec (SPEC-058). Interim fallback:
  feature-gate a C decoder (dav1d/aom) for speed where the toolchain exists — never the default.
- **Real work is color/alpha/grid, not the codec:** bit depth (8/10/12), 4:2:0/2:2/4:4:4, nclx/CICP
  matrix+range, premultiplied alpha; and grid/tiled AVIF may be unsupported by `avif-parse` (reject
  cleanly). `re_rav1d` is rerun's "messy" fork → pin + keep the glue surface thin.
- **Parallel / future (not blocking):** contribute **image-rs #2621** upstream (trivial; PoC exists)
  and/or a native Rust API into `rav1d`, to later migrate to `image`'s built-in decode. **Watchlist**
  the **OxideAV** MIT stack (`oxideav-avif`+`oxideav-av1`, pure-Rust, intra-only, sub-1.0) as the
  potentially-cleanest single MIT stack for both AVIF and HEIC once it matures.
- **Patent contrast to record:** AV1/AVIF is royalty-free (no HEVC-style pool) — this is *why*
  it can be default where HEIC cannot (DEC-052).
- **Wiring is small once the decoder exists:** format dispatch is automatic in
  `decode_with_limits` (`ImageReader::with_guessed_format`); the deltas are the `Cargo.toml`
  feature/dep, one line in `IMAGE_EXTENSIONS`, and decode-cap/error tests.

## Dependencies

### Depends on
- Shipped decode seam (`src/image/mod.rs:271`, `src/source/mod.rs:94`, `src/error.rs`).
- DEC-004 (pure-Rust default), DEC-034 (decode caps), DEC-018 (`no-agpl-default-deps`).

### Enables
- STAGE-017/018 (shared container/decoder patterns), roadmap Wave 3 (in-browser AVIF), and
  richer optimize/lint coverage.

## Stage-Level Reflection

- **Did we deliver the outcome in "What This Stage Is"?** Yes — the default binary now reads
  `.avif` end to end (optimize/convert/info/batch), pure-Rust, zero system deps, clean on Windows
  with no nasm. PR #65, 20/20 CI green. AVIF/AV1's royalty-free patent status made a default path
  legitimate (the HEIC contrast, DEC-052).
- **How many specs did it actually take?** 1 (SPEC-058). The hedged SPEC-059 (container) was folded
  in — `avif-parse` covered the container within SPEC-058.
- **What changed between starting and shipping?** The framing's "no clean permissive drop-in →
  maybe SVG should lead" pessimism was overturned by the deep dive: `re_rav1d` (no-asm) exposes a
  safe Rust API + `avif-parse` handles the container, so AVIF kept the Wave-1 headline.
- **Lessons that should update AGENTS.md, templates, or constraints?**
  - Run `just deny` right after `cargo add` on a large decoder — big deps drag a license tail onto
    the default path (here MPL-2.0 + a CC0 transitive + a `paste` advisory), a mid-build surprise.
  - The CI `msrv` job pins a HARDCODED toolchain — a dep raising the floor needs a manual `ci.yml`
    bump (avif-parse → 1.90). Worth noting in the MSRV constraint/docs.
  - One residual: `fuzz/avif_decode` ships but was never run (no nightly) — tracked as a pre-1.0
    hardening gate in `docs/roadmap.md`; do not lose it on an untrusted-input decoder.
