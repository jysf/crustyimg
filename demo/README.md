# The crustyimg demo

A static page that runs the crustyimg engine **in your browser**. Drop an image, convert it,
download the result — nothing is uploaded, and there is no backend to upload it to. The engine is
the same pure-Rust code the CLI runs, compiled to WebAssembly and shipped as
[`crustyimg-wasm`](../npm/README.md).

```
just demo-serve      # build it, serve it, print a URL
just demo-smoke      # prove it: drive the served page in a real headless browser
```

## ⚠ It must be SERVED. You cannot open `index.html` from your filesystem.

Double-clicking `demo/index.html` gives you a `file://` URL, and the page will not work — the
browser blocks it twice over:

1. **`demo.js` never runs.** It is an ES module, and module scripts are fetched under CORS. A
   `file://` origin is opaque, so the browser refuses the module before executing a line of it —
   no import, no `init()`, no error in the console.
2. **The WebAssembly could not stream anyway.** `init()` fetches `crustyimg_bg.wasm` and hands it
   to `WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming`, which requires the server to send it as
   `application/wasm`. A `file://` fetch has no MIME type to send.

The page detects this and tells you so, rather than sitting on "Loading the engine…" forever. Any
static HTTP server fixes it; `just demo-serve` runs one (it is 60 lines of `node:http` — see
`scripts/serve.mjs` — and the load-bearing line in it is the `.wasm → application/wasm` entry).
GitHub Pages serves the right MIME type too, which is why the deploy Just Works.

No COOP/COEP headers are needed. The conversions run in a **Web Worker** — a separate thread, not
shared memory — so there is no `SharedArrayBuffer` and no wasm-threads build to unlock. (Which is
fortunate: GitHub Pages cannot set headers.)

## What it does

| | |
|---|---|
| **In** | PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, SVG (rasterized by resvg, `<text>` and all), AVIF |
| **Out** | AVIF, WebP (lossless), JPEG (auto-quality), PNG — or **Auto**, and the engine picks |
| **Resize** | optional max long edge — runs a real recipe, the same TOML the CLI reads |
| **Explains** | bytes in → out and % saved, the format chosen and by whom, the dimensions, and how the quality was decided |
| **Runs** | entirely on your machine, in a Worker: no server, no upload, no network call for the conversion |

### Why a Worker (SPEC-078)

`rav1e` — the AVIF encoder in this `.wasm` — is **serial and slow**, and a wasm call is synchronous.
Called from the page's thread it would freeze the tab for the whole encode, which is why SPEC-077
shipped with AVIF disabled. `demo/worker.js` runs the engine on its own thread instead, so the page
keeps painting while it works. Every conversion goes through it, not just AVIF.

The busy indicator is a **spinner, not a percentage**: one conversion is a single blocking call
inside the worker and rav1e reports nothing as it goes, so a progress bar would be a lie about
information we do not have. What is true — and what the browser smoke asserts — is that the main
thread keeps running throughout.

### AVIF goes in one direction only

This build **encodes** AVIF and cannot **decode** it (DEC-065 — the decoder is a different codec that
does not build for bare wasm32). So:

* an `.avif` **input** is decoded by *your browser* (`createImageBitmap` → an `OffscreenCanvas` →
  PNG bytes → the engine), and the page says so rather than implying the engine did it;
* an AVIF **output**'s dimensions are read back by your browser's decoder too — the engine cannot
  check its own work here, so an independent decoder does.

Neither borrows a codec into the wasm; both borrow the one already in the browser.

### Quality, honestly

There is no quality **slider**, because the shipped wasm surface takes no quality argument (DEC-064)
— a slider would control nothing. The engine decides, and the readout says which of these happened:

* **JPEG** — quality *searched* with SSIMULACRA2 until the result is visually lossless (the engine's
  real auto-quality: it decodes every candidate to score it);
* **AVIF** — the encoder's *default* quality, **not** searched: a perceptual search must decode each
  candidate, and this build cannot decode AVIF;
* **WebP / PNG** — *lossless*, so there is no quality to choose. Lossy WebP is a C library and this
  build is pure Rust, which means re-encoding an already-lossy JPEG to WebP can legitimately produce
  a **bigger** file. The page says so when it happens instead of hiding it — try AVIF, or cap the
  long edge.

## How it is built

There is no bundler, no framework, and no `npm install`. The whole build is:

```
just demo-build
  ├── just wasm-build          # the size-profiled .wasm (DEC-066) → pkg/
  └── scripts/demo-assemble.mjs
        ├── refuse any .wasm that did not come through that recipe  ← the assembly guard
        └── copy pkg/crustyimg.js + crustyimg_bg.wasm → demo/vendor/
```

`demo/vendor/` is a build output — regenerated every time, never committed. The guard is
structural, not a size band: a size-profiled `.wasm` is stripped, so its `name` debug section is
~42 B where an unprofiled one carries ~980 KB. That difference is categorical and does not decay as
the engine grows. (Same check the npm package uses — `scripts/lib/wasm-artifact.mjs`.)

`.github/workflows/pages.yml` runs exactly that, gates it on `just demo-smoke` in a real browser,
and publishes `demo/` to GitHub Pages.

## Files

| File | |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | the page (and the classic script that explains the `file://` failure) |
| `demo.js` | the page's half: drop → post to the worker → render what it decided |
| `worker.js` | the engine's thread: `init()`s the wasm, converts, and borrows the browser's AVIF decoder |
| `demo.css` | the whole stylesheet |
| `vendor/` | the vendored `crustyimg-wasm` build output — generated, gitignored |
